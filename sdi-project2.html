<p>The theme I choose is critiquing the types bacon. Most people do not know there are many flavors and ways to cook this wonderful treat.</p>
<p>Bacon, also known as "natures candy" by my world will be explained by my code. In addition for those who do not like pork there are turkey bacon and faken which is tofu bacon. Not "natures candy" by my standards.</p>
