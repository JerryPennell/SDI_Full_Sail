<p>I choose to continue with the theme of bacon because I wanted to expand my story and code with the learned methods this week.</p>
<p>My goal was to add in more information about bacon as if I were rating it, creating it and seeking ultimate bacon Nirvana!</p>
<p>In addition to my story I wanted to refactor the bacon theme incorporating the new JSON feature.</p>
